N-Queens Solution Count Results
================================

Implementation: Incremental SAT solving using PySAT Glucose3 solver
Platform: Ubuntu Linux
Python: 3.x with python-sat library

Test Results (All verified against OEIS A000170):
=================================================

N=4:  2 solutions ✓ (Generated 80 clauses, 16 variables)
      - Shows individual solutions for small cases
      - Runtime: < 1 second

N=5:  10 solutions ✓ (Generated 165 clauses, 25 variables)  
      - Shows all 10 distinct solutions
      - Runtime: < 1 second

N=6:  4 solutions ✓ (Generated 296 clauses, 36 variables)
      - Shows all 4 distinct solutions
      - Runtime: < 1 second

N=8:  92 solutions ✓ (Generated 736 clauses, 64 variables)
      - Progress reporting every 10 solutions
      - Runtime: ~2-3 seconds

N=9:  352 solutions ✓ (Generated 1065 clauses, 81 variables)
      - Progress reporting shows steady enumeration
      - Runtime: ~10-15 seconds

N=10: 724 solutions ✓ (Generated 1480 clauses, 100 variables)
      - Largest test case, significant enumeration
      - Runtime: ~30-45 seconds

Verification Status:
===================
All results perfectly match the known OEIS sequence A000170:
https://oeis.org/A000170

Expected: 1, 0, 0, 2, 10, 4, 40, 92, 352, 724, 2680, 14200, ...
Our results:     -, -, -, 2, 10, 4,  -, 92, 352, 724

Algorithm Performance:
=====================
- SAT encoding scales as expected: O(n^2) variables, O(n^3) clauses
- Incremental solving efficiently enumerates all solutions
- Solution blocking prevents duplicate solutions
- Progress reporting for larger instances (n≥8)
- Memory usage remains reasonable for tested sizes

Implementation Features:
=======================
✓ Correct SAT encoding with all N-Queens constraints
✓ Row constraints: exactly one queen per row
✓ Column constraints: at most one queen per column  
✓ Diagonal constraints: both directions handled
✓ Incremental SAT solving with solution enumeration
✓ Automatic verification against known results
✓ Clean output formatting and progress reporting
✓ Robust error handling and input validation

Conclusion:
===========
The incremental SAT approach successfully solves the N-Queens 
solution counting problem. All test cases produce correct results
that match the authoritative OEIS sequence, demonstrating the
correctness of both the SAT encoding and the enumeration algorithm.

The implementation handles reasonable problem sizes efficiently
and could be extended to larger instances with appropriate
computational resources.
